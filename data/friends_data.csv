Chandler,well the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community,9,17
Ross,i cannot believe this not even my geology lab partner and i carried that guy gets up from his sofa,9,17
Chandler,alright look let is think about this ok do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time that people are gonna post condolences on a website this is not about people not caring that you are dead this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief,9,17
Ross,you are right there isnot a decent outlet,9,17
Chandler,right i mean come on im sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service tons of people would come,9,17

Rachel,to herself oh god,9,17
Joey, she is being unreasonable,9,17
Rachel,yelling joey there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much joey covers hugsy is ears oh do not cover its ears stops yelling it is because it reminds her of her uncle joey,9,17

Rachel,look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan so leathery and wrinkled im so jealous,9,23
Ross,finally factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered gigantosaurus argentinasaurus,9,23
Chandler,to a paleontologist sitting next to him not to mention the cold sores,9,23
Ross,and that is just the herbivores im not even gonna discuss the carnivores their heads are already too big which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development,9,23
Chandler,to the one sitting next to him really,9,23
Ross,but all kidding aside in much the same way that homo ergaster 1 is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus,9,23
Joey,he said erectus,9,23
Joey,no he really said it,9,23
Ross, and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus,9,23
Joey,erectus,9,23
